##  arithmetic (input1, input2, choice)

This method is used for to perform the basic `arithmetic` operations like `Addition(+)`, `Subtraction(-)`, `Multiplication(*)`, `Division(/)`, `Modulo(%)`. In arithmetic method it will took three arguments `input1`, `input2`, and `choice`.

**input1**: This is the first operand value.
**input2**: This is the second operand value.
**choice**: User will choose one option from [+, -, *, /, %]

    Addition = num1 + num2
    Subtraction = num1 - num2
    Multiplication = num1 * num2
    Division = num1 / num2
    Modulo(Remainder) = num1 % num2

### Example Code

```javascript
import {arithmetic} from "math-unlimited";
let num1 = 100, num2 = 200;
console.log(arithmetic(num1, num2, "Addition")); // 300
console.log(arithmetic(num1, num2, "SUBTRACTION")); // -100
console.log(arithmetic(num1, num2, "multiplication")); // 20000
console.log(arithmetic(num1, num2, "DiViSiOn")); // 0.5
console.log(arithmetic(num1, num2, "mODULO")); // 100
```

In the above code you can observe after added the input1 and input2 i wrote the options in different types of string writing format patterns. but the code is working fine. The reason is in the package  i convert the string into `lowercase` so you can give any type of string writing format.

## division (input1, input2, choice)

This method is used for to perform the Division operation and it will display the `Divisor`, `Dividend`, `Quotient` and `Remainder`. In division method it will took three arguments `input1`, `input2`, `choice`.

**input1**: This is the first operand value.  
**input2**: This is the second operand value.  
**choice**: User will choose one option from [Divisor, Dividend, Quotient, Remainder]

![Division Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/duke5nl3i/image/upload/v1744910976/Division_aj1rzn.png)

### Example Code

```javascript
import {division} from "math-unlimited";
let num1 = 150, num2 = 7;
console.log(division(num1, num2, "Dividend")); // 150
console.log(division(num1, num2, "dIVISOR")); // 7
console.log(division(num1, num2, "Quotient")); // 21.428571428571427
console.log(division(num1, num2, "REMAINDER")); // 3
```
In the above code you can observe after added the input1 and input2 i wrote the options in different types of string writing format patterns. but the code is working fine. The reason is in the package i convert the string into `lowercase` so you can give any type of string writing format.

##  evenOdd(input)

This method is used for to calculate either the number is `Even Number` or `Odd Number`. This is particularly used for to calculate and return only for Even and Odd Number. In this method it need only one argument `input` and it must be Integer type.

**input**: Using the value of this argument code will calculate for even and odd.

```javascript
if(i % 2 === 0) {
	return "Even Number";
} else {
	return "Odd Number";
}
```

### Example Code

```javascript
import {evenOdd} from "math-unlimited";
console.log(evenOdd(20)); // Even Number
console.log(evenOdd(21)); // Odd Number
```

## isDivisible(input, divisibleBy)

This method is used for to calculate any number is divisible by any given number of not. This method need two arguments `input` and `divisibleBy` and in output it will return String output.

```javascript
if(input % divisibleBy === 0) {
	return `${input} Divisible By ${divisibleBy}.`
} else {
	return `${input} Is Not Divisible By ${divisibleBy}.`
}
```
### Example Code

```javascript
import {isDivisible} from  "math-unlimited";
console.log(isDivisible(20, 3)); // 20 Is Not Divisible By 3.
console.log(isDivisible(21, 3)); // 21 Divisible By 3.
```
