## arithmetic (Operand1, Operand2, OperatorChoice)

This method is used for to perform the basic `arithmetic` operations like `Addition(+)`, `Subtraction(-)`, `Multiplication(*)`, `Division(/)`, `Modulo(%)`. In arithmetic method it will took three arguments `input1`, `input2`, and `OperatorChoice`.

**Operand1**: This is the first operand value.

**Operand2**: This is the second operand value.

**OperatorChoice**: User will choose one option from [+, -, *, /, %]
  
```code
Addition = Operand1 + Operand2
Subtraction = Operand1 - Operand2
Multiplication = Operand1 * Operand2
Division = Operand1 / Operand2
Modulo(Remainder) = Operand1 % Operand2
```

## Example Code

```javascript
import {arithmetic} from  "math-unlimited";
let  Operand1 = 100, Operand2 = 200;
console.log(arithmetic(Operand1, Operand2, "Addition")); // 300
console.log(arithmetic(Operand1, Operand2, "SUBTRACTION")); // -100
console.log(arithmetic(Operand1, Operand2, "multiplication")); // 20000
console.log(arithmetic(Operand1, Operand2, "DiViSiOn")); // 0.5
console.log(arithmetic(Operand1, Operand2, "mODULO")); // 100
```

In the above code you can observe after added the input1 and input2 i wrote the options in different types of string writing format patterns. but the code is working fine. The reason is in the package i convert the string into `lowercase` so you can give any type of string writing format.

## division (Dividend, Divisor, DivisionChoice)

This method is used for to perform the Division operation and it will display the `Divisor`, `Dividend`, `Quotient` and `Remainder`. In division method it will took three arguments `Dividend`, `Divisor`, `DivisionChoice`.

**Dividend**: This is the first operand value.

**Divisor**: This is the second operand value.

**DivisionChoice**: User will choose one option from [Divisor, Dividend, Quotient, Remainder]

console.log(division(Dividend, Divisor, "Quotient")); // 21.428571428571427
console.log(division(Dividend, Divisor, "REMAINDER")); // 3
```

In the above code you can observe after added the input1 and input2 i wrote the options in different types of string writing format patterns. but the code is working fine. The reason is in the package i convert the string into `lowercase` so you can give any type of string writing format.

## factorialNumber(n)

The given function `factorialNumber` is a TypeScript implementation of a recursive algorithm to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer. It uses memoization to optimize performance by caching previously computed results. Memoization is achieved using the `factorialCache` object, which maps input numbers to their corresponding factorial values.

The factorial of a number `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n`. For example, 
```javascript
5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
Special cases include 0!=1, which is a standard mathematical definition.
```
The `factorialNumber(n)` has only one argument which is `n: number` so user will send a integer parameter to the function.

## Example Code

```javascript
import {factorialNumber} from "math-unlimited";
console.log(factorialNumber(5));  // 120
console.log(factorialNumber(6)); // 720
console.log(factorialNumber(10)); // 3628800
```

##  permutation(n, r)

The given function `permutation` calculates the number of permutations of `r` objects selected from a set of `n` distinct objects. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order, and the formula for calculating permutations is: **P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!**. Here, `n!` is the factorial of nnn, and `(nâˆ’r)!` is the factorial of `nâˆ’r`. The function uses the previously defined `factorialNumber` function to compute these factorial values. The permutation(n, r) has two arguments **n: number** and **r: number** which need integer parameters to perform the Permutation operation.

```javascript
import {permutation} from "math-unlimited";
console.log(permutation(5, 3)); // Output: 60
console.log(permutation(6, 2)); // Output: 30
console.log(permutation(4, 4)); // Output: 24
console.log(permutation(9, 6)); // Output: 60480
```

##  combination(n, r)

The `combination` function calculates the number of combinations of `r `objects selected from a set of `n` distinct objects. In combinations, the order of selection does not matter. The mathematical formula for combinations is: **C(n, r) = n! / r! x (n - r)!** `n!` is the factorial of `n`, `r!` is the factorial of `r`, and  `(nâˆ’r)!` is the factorial of `nâˆ’r`.  This function leverages the `factorialNumber` function to compute the factorial values and calculates the result using the above formula.

```JavaScript
import {combination} from "math-unlimited";
console.log(combination(9, 6)); // Output: 84
console.log(combination(5, 3)); // Output: 10
console.log(combination(6, 2)); // Output: 15
console.log(combination(4, 4)); // Output: 1
```
